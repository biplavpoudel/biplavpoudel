## 🚀 About Me

Cloud and platform engineer focused on Linux systems, distributed networking, and building automated infrastructure that behaves predictably under load.  
My work often sits at the boundary where operating systems, cloud platforms, and intelligent automation intersect.

I enjoy architecting systems from first principles—DNS that resolves fast and correctly, networks that are stable and debuggable, and cloud environments that scale without drama.

## 🧩 Core Engineering Expertise

### **Linux Systems Engineering**
Deep experience designing and operating Linux-based infrastructure across Fedora, RHEL, and Oracle Linux environments.  
Comfortable with the entire plumbing layer: systemd, journald, SELinux, cgroups, firewalls, and performance tuning.  
Hands-on with DNS, DHCP, DDNS, DNSSEC, FreeIPA/IdM, Kerberos, SSSD, and secure certificate management.  
Use Bash as a practical automation tool for provisioning, bootstrap workflows, and service orchestration.

---

### **Networking**
Strong grounding in IPv4/IPv6 fundamentals, routing, subnetting, NAT, and relay architectures.  
Build authoritative and recursive DNS systems using Bind9 and run Kea DHCP infrastructures with advanced relay setups.  
Design virtual networks using KVM/QEMU bridges, NAT forwarding, and OPNsense firewalls.  
Architect and troubleshoot cloud networking on AWS, OCI, and hybrid setups.

---

### **Cloud Architecture & Platform Engineering**
Experience creating scalable, secure environments on AWS and Oracle Cloud.  
Work spans compute, IAM, load balancing, VPC/VCN design, observability pipelines, and event-driven automation.  
Skilled in agentic automation using Python async workflows, FastAPI services, GitHub Actions, and multi-LLM integration.

---

### **Containers, Orchestration & Virtualization**
Operate Kubernetes clusters and OpenShift environments for containerized workloads.  
Use Podman and Docker for local and production deployments.  
Leverage Terraform for infrastructure automation and GitOps workflows.  
Extensive hands-on work with KVM/QEMU virtualization—bridged networks, overlays, cloud-init provisioning, and multi-VM topologies.
